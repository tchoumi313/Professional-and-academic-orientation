## About The Project

Over time, it has been noticed that after obtaining their baccalaureate, young people are subjected to an embarrassment of choices as to what will happen to their future, this creates a disorder in them. In addition, being new to the subject, they need lighting, especially not all of them have the possibility of having knowledgeable people nearby who can help them. Still others are ashamed to meet face-to-face with guidance counsellors. As it is often said, "Knowledge is good, but knowledge is better"; It is with a view to supporting, giving hope to these young people and their loved ones, we have set up the project to create our # academic and professional orientation website.
